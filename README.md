# hello-world
My first repository

Hi,

I'm Wei Chun Chang, a.k.a Marcus.
I'm a self-motivated data scientist who just graduated this January (2018), finished my military duty (2018/02/22-2018/06/12), and now seeking for a job that I can apply my capibility to real-world business.
I use Python,R, and SQL to do data analysis. Having some experience in Machine Learning, I'm now taking Data Science Nano-degree on Udacity to reinforce my skills. 
I have some kernels on Kaggle that you might be interested in.

Here is the link:

I'm here to build some projects and a portfolio, helping myself getting a data science job and helping someone like me in the future.

Cheers,
Wei Chun Chang
